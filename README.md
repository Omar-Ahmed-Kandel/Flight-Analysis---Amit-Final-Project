## Executive Summary
A Power BI dashboard summarizes flight operations, passenger demographics, and aircraft utilization to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives & Key Questions
- Which airlines fly the most flights?  
- Are flight durations increasing or decreasing?  
- Which airports have the highest and lowest flight volumes?  
- What is the passenger nationality distribution?  
- Which aircraft models record the most flight hours?  
- How do male and female passenger counts compare?  
- What is the breakdown of passengers by age group and gender?  
- Are we meeting our 1,500‑hour flight duration target?

## Data Preparation
- Imported and related all source tables in Power BI.  
- Cleansed missing values and standardized data types.  
- Added a “Customer Type” column based on age groups (Child, Teen, Adult, Senior).

## Key Measures & KPIs
- **Total Flights**  
- **Average Flight Duration**  
- **Total Passengers**  
- **Male Passengers** vs. **Female Passengers**  
- **Passenger Nationality Count**  
- **Flight Duration Target** (1,500 hours)

## Insights & Recommendations
- Prioritize top‑performing airlines and routes.  
- Investigate drivers behind flight duration trends.  
- Explore opportunities at under‑used airports.  
- Tailor services for key nationalities and age groups.  
- Plan maintenance based on aircraft utilization.  
- Monitor gender and age distributions continuously.  
- Track progress toward the 1,500‑hour target.

## Limitations
- Analysis covers a single year; extend to multi‑year for robust trends.  
- Lacks cost and revenue data for profitability analysis.  
- Next enhancements: on‑time performance, load-factor metrics, year-over-year comparisons.

## Next Steps & Decisions
- **Expand Key Routes:** Increase service at under‑served airports.  
- **Target Delay Reduction:** Address top 3 delay causes by airline/model.  
- **Customize Experience:** Roll out offerings for top nationalities and age groups.  
- **Optimize Maintenance:** Schedule checks for high‑hour aircraft; retire under‑utilized models.  
- **Automate Monitoring:** Implement daily dashboard refreshes and alerts for key KPIs.
